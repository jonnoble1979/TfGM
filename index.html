            <h2>Getting Advice on Road Safety</h2>
            <p>All design projects should undergo a Road Safety Review early in the design. The cost for this is minimal (1-2 hours of an expert's time), and ensures designers are aware of road safety issues early. This minimises potential issues and re-design. Contact the WSP road safety team to arrange this. They will ensure the team doing the reviews is different from the one doing the road safety audits to ensure the total independence of the latter from the design as per process.</p>
            <p>At any time during the design process if you have any road safety concerns with your projects the WSP road safety team are here and available to offer an opinion, help and advice (again they will make sure independence of the RSA team is maintained).</p>
