        <h2>Initiating the Road Safety Audit</h2>
        <p class="mandatory">The Overseeing Organisation is responsible for initiating the RSA, ensuring that sufficient time is available to complete the full process. This shall include an allowance for the incorporation of changes into the design that may arise from the RSA.</p>
        <p class="mandatory">TfGM’s in-house Road Safety Team shall be notified of the intention to undertake a RSA on the KRN, or for TfGM schemes.</p>
        <p>Scheme information, including an RSA brief and appropriate Improvement Scheme plans should be provided in all cases and sent via <a href="mailto:roadsafetyaudit@tfgm.com">roadsafetyaudit@tfgm.com</a></p>
        <p>An RSA is initiated by the submission of the RSA brief to the approved RSA Team at the appropriate stages of a scheme’s development.</p>

        <h2>Road Safety Audit Brief</h2>
        <p class="mandatory">The Overseeing Organisation shall have responsibility for approving and issuing the RSA brief to the RSA team.</p>
        <p>The RSA brief defines the scope of the RSA to be undertaken. An example RSA brief template is included within Appendix XXX.</p>
        <p>The Scheme Manager has overall responsibility for the RSA brief. However, the Design Team or a suitable officer delegated to by the Scheme Manager may prepare the RSA brief on their behalf. The Overseeing Organisation’s Specialist may be consulted for advice regarding the scope of the RSA/the most suitable team, if required.</p>
        <p class="mandatory">The Scheme Manager or delegated officer shall issue the RSA Brief and instruct the RSA Team when the scheme is ready to be Road Safety Audited.</p>
        <p>An overview of the information required when completing an RSA brief is contained within Appendix XXX.</p>
        <p>The RSA Team Leader considers the RSA brief and will direct any requests for additional information, clarification of (or inadequacies in) the brief to the Scheme Manager or delegated officer. If any points raised or the inadequacies are not resolved then the RSA brief may ultimately be either rejected or, if appropriate, an earlier stage of RSA undertaken.</p>
        <p>Although the roles and responsibilities of those involved are clearly defined in the procedure, a flowchart illustrating the RSA process and who has responsibility at each stage is provided in Appendix XXX.</p>
        <p>RSA briefs should define the terms of reference of the RSA requested, including applicable design guidelines or standards used.</p>
        <p>The decision regarding the appropriate design standards to be used should be made by the Overseeing Organisation. Where a relevant Design Standard has not been identified within the RSA brief, it will be assumed that DMRB has been used.</p>
        <p class="mandatory">Where the RSA brief has been prepared by the Design Team, the Scheme Manager or delegated officer shall formally sign off the brief.</p>
        <p>The Scheme Manager may instruct the Design Team to delete unnecessary items or to include additional material, as they consider appropriate.</p>

    <h2>Appointing and Approving the Road Safety Audit Team</h2>
    <p>It is the responsibility of the Scheme Manager or the officer with delegated responsibility to ensure an appropriately experienced RSA Team for each stage of RSA.</p>
    <p>The Scheme Manager should ensure an RSA Team that comprises at least two competent people with appropriate skills; knowledge; experience; and qualifications to the satisfaction of the Overseeing Organisation whether that is the Highway Authority or TfGM for TfGM projects.</p>
    <p>It is not necessary for the same RSA Team to undertake all RSA stages of a scheme. However, the Scheme Manager should be notified of any changes to an RSA Team.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Road Safety Audit Team Independence</h2>
        <p>It is fundamental to the RSA process that no member of the RSA Team has had any design involvement with the scheme being audited and will maintain this independence throughout the RSA process.</p>
        <p class="mandatory">The Overseeing Organisation shall be satisfied as to the independence and competence of the RSA Team to undertake the RSA.</p>
        <p>The requirement for the RSA Team’s independence does not preclude direct contact between the RSA Team, Overseeing Organisation and Design Organisation. There may be times where there is clear benefit in allowing this to happen; for example, in clarifying the RSA Brief.</p>
        <p class="mandatory">However, this procedure does recognise that direct contact may be unavoidable if the RSA Team Organisation and Design Organisation are one and the same. It is of paramount importance, however, that the RSA Team maintains its independence. The Overseeing Organisation and Design Organisation shall not in any way influence the outcome of the RSA by discussing any design considerations or issues with the RSA Team.</p>
        <p>The RSA Team is not permitted to go beyond making recommendations in broad terms. In making detailed recommendations the RSA Team may be seen to be taking on design responsibilities and hence, lose its independence from the design process.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Road Safety Audit Shelf Life</h2>
        <p class="mandatory">All pre-construction RSAs have a maximum shelf life of 5 years. Where a scheme has not begun the next stage in its development within five years of the completion of the RSA, the scheme shall be re-audited. This is to ensure that due consideration has been given to the schemes interface with the current highway network and its current usage.</p>
        <h3>Design Changes</h3>
        <p>RSAs should be repeated if any element of a scheme is significantly changed, or the highway layout is substantially altered, subsequent to an RSA having been undertaken.</p>
