        <h2>Team Approval</h2>
        <p>The Scheme Manager should select an RSA Team that comprises at least two competent people with appropriate skills; knowledge; experience; and qualifications to the satisfaction of the Overseeing Organisation whether that is the Highway Authority or TfGM for TfGM projects.</p>
        <p class="mandatory">When assessing the competency of an RSA Team, details of both the RSA Team Leader and the RSA Team Member are shall be required in all instances.</p>
        <p>Approvals of the RSA team are scheme and RSA stage-specific and the use of personnel or organisations on previous RSAs should not guarantee their suitability to undertake an RSA on other schemes.</p>
        <p>Proposed members of the RSA team shall demonstrate their competency by means of a road safety specific curriculum vitae (CV) detailing training, continuing professional development (CPD) and experience.</p>
        <p>Experience should be relevant to the type of scheme being subject to RSA and identified in the proposed RSA team members' CV.</p>
        <p>Where an RSA is requested on schemes which feature proposals in the vicinity of any Metrolink or transport Interchange infrastructure at least one member of the RSA Team should be able to demonstrate prior experience (e.g. scheme design, collision investigation or Road Safety Auditing) of these types of schemes. The suitability of the RSA Team’s experience will be assessed by the Scheme Manager on a scheme-by-scheme basis.</p>
