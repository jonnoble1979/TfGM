        <p>
          This procedure shall apply to all improvement schemes where an RSA is undertaken on local roads in Greater Manchester. This includes work carried out under agreement with the Overseeing Organisation resulting from developments alongside or affecting the highway and improvement schemes being promoted by third party organisations. Also include Metrolink and Bee Network Interchanges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improvement schemes that will not impact on road user behaviour or adversely change the outcome of an incident involving an errant vehicle, due to the nature of the works and/or the distance of the improvement from the operational highway, may be excluded from the RSA process. If the Scheme Manager is unclear on how to proceed in such situations, they should consult with their organisational or TfGM Specialist Advisor to help determine whether an RSA is required.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a decision is made to not carry out an RSA this shall be formally recorded on the scheme file by the Overseeing Organisation’s Scheme Manager.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where a decision has been made by the Scheme Manager to not apply RSA to a scheme it is recommended that the ‘Scheme Exemption File Note’ proforma in Appendix XXX is used to record the reasons for the decision.
        </p>

        <h4>Maintenance schemes</h4>
        <p>
          Like-for-like maintenance schemes are excluded from RSA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improvement schemes that are constructed as part of the same procurement package as maintenance works shall be subject to the RSA process, if the works have the potential to change road user behaviour or adversely change the outcome of an incident involving an errant vehicle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scheme Managers and Designers shall ensure that any like-for-like replacement or refurbishment scheme does not reinstate a feature that is known by the organisation to adversely affect road user safety (e.g., the replacement of a non‑passively safe traffic sign in the same location where it has been previously struck by errant road users on numerous occasions).
        </p>

        <h4>Temporary traffic management schemes</h4>
        <p>
          This procedure is not generally required for application to temporary traffic management schemes. The Department for Transport publication “Safety at Street Works and Road Works — A Code of Practice” and Chapter 8 of the Traffic Signs Manual contains the necessary guidance to facilitate the safe planning and implementation of temporary traffic management activities. However, RSA should be applied to exceptional temporary traffic management schemes that involve temporary changes to the layout and operation of junctions or realignment of roads that will affect the network for a considerable period.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          <strong>NOTE 1</strong> — Temporary measures that last 6 months or longer in duration are considered to be physical changes to the highway. Examples of such measures include: (1) temporary traffic management, and (2) temporary changes to the highway not associated with the construction of a highway scheme.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          <strong>NOTE 2</strong> — Temporary measures that last less than 6 months in duration are not considered to be physical changes to the highway.
        </p>

        <h4>Non road safety related matters</h4>
        <p>
          An RSA is a formal, systematic, independent assessment of the potential road safety problems associated with a new improvement scheme and the process will therefore not consider non‑road safety related matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Non road safety related matters can however be included separately in a covering letter to the Scheme Manager; however, time spent identifying these issues should not distract from the RSA process itself.
        </p>

        <h4>Standard check</h4>
        <p>
          The RSA is not a technical check on highway design standards or traffic regulations, or a check on whether the scheme has been constructed in accordance with the design.
        </p>

        <h4>Design comparison</h4>
        <p>
          An RSA shall not be used as a means of selecting between various design options that are under consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          An RSA may be conducted on separate options but no definitive judgement on which option is preferable will be given. The RSA Team will assess each option individually and make recommendations accordingly. The decision on which option to develop will remain entirely with the Designer and the Overseeing Organisation.
        </p>

        <h4>Health and safety</h4>
        <p>
          RSA does not cover health &amp; safety legislation issues concerning the construction, maintenance and use of the road. Only issues relating to the design and construction of facilities for highway maintenance that may potentially contribute to a road safety matter should be considered by the RSA process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the RSA Team’s contribution to design is limited, it is recommended that RSA Teams make themselves aware of current health &amp; safety legislation and consider the implications of their recommendations for the health &amp; safety of others.
        </p>

        <h4>Structures</h4>
        <p>
          An RSA does not cover issues relating to the stability of any structure, nor the structural integrity of any proposed element or method of construction.
        </p>

        <h4>Issues to be covered</h4>
        <p>
          Advice is given on the general aspects that should be addressed at RSA Stages 1, 2 and 3 in the lists in Appendices XXX and XXX of this procedure. The lists in Appendices XXX and XXX are not intended to be exhaustive. They provide a prompt for optional supplementary checks that RSA Teams could make following their less prescriptive and more wide‑ranging RSA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Road Safety Auditors shall examine the overall layout of the improvement scheme. All users of the highway shall be considered including motorists, people walking, wheeling, cycling, riders of powered two wheelers and equestrian users, and facilities for those working on the highway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Particular attention should be given to vulnerable road users such as the very young, older users and the mobility and visually impaired and people with additional physical and neurodivergent needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The potential for road safety problems is often greatest at junctions, where the new scheme meets the existing layout and immediately beyond where the new scheme meets the existing layout. Where an improvement scheme joins an existing road or junction, inconsistency in the standard of provision may potentially lead to collisions, so particular attention should be paid to these areas to ensure the safest possible transition is achieved. This applies particularly to intermittent improvements along a length of road where variations in the standard of provision between new and existing sections may not be obvious to the road user.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, when conducting RSAs on proposed Metrolink schemes or on schemes proposed adjacent to any Metrolink infrastructure, particular consideration should be given to likely road safety issues relating to cyclists. For example, where a cyclist needs to traverse the tram lines at a shallow angle; or where complex alternative facilities have been provided, the attractiveness of the alternative facility shall be considered. Further guidance for tram/cycle road safety issues is provided in the respective stages of RSA checklists and report templates provided as an Appendix to this Procedures document.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Panel 3 -->
      <section id="panel-rsa-3" class="tabs__panel" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab-rsa-3-label">
      
        <p>
          When making recommendations for dealing with identified problems, RSA Teams should make allowance for the fact that strategic decisions on matters, such as route choice, junction type, and standard of provision, already reflect an appropriate balance of a number of factors including road safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recommendations requiring major changes in these areas are unlikely to be acceptable when balanced with other aspects of the scheme and the RSA Team should not make such proposals. In the unlikely situation where the road safety implications of the strategic decisions have not been fully considered previously, the Scheme Manager may extend the scope of the RSA to include consideration of these items.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Scheme Manager should clearly identify within the RSA Brief where the scope of the RSA has been extended to cover strategic decisions.
