                <h1>Getting Advice on Road Safety</h1>
                <p class="intro-text">All design projects should undergo a Road Safety Review early in the design. The cost for this is minimal (1-2 hours of an expert's time), and ensures designers are aware of road safety issues early. This minimises potential issues and re-design. Contact the WSP road safety team to arrange this. They will ensure the team doing the reviews is appropriately qualified to advise on road safety matters.</p>
