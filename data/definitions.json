    "term": "Road Safety Audit (RSA)",
    "definition": "An RSA is the staged evaluation of the changes to the highway during design, implementation and subsequent operation. It seeks to identify potential road safety hazards that may result in personal injury for any type of road user and to suggest measures to eliminate or mitigate those problems. This evaluation is carried out during the design stages (Stages 1 & 2), as closely as possible after the measures become operational (Stage 3), and with 12 months of validated Personal Injury Collision data to enable an accurate comparison between the ‘pre-construction period’ and control data for the ‘post-construction period’ after the scheme becomes operational (Stage 4)."
